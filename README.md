A study guide for course prework
# Useful tips to help with using HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript - and introduction

## Description

I created this guide as an exercise through bootcamp for front end web development. It was an exercise in showing you how to use the various languages HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript in designing and manipulating webpages

-I am motivated to learn this course in order to help me improve web design and see freelance career opportunities in this field
- I built this project to understand the principles of these languages in web desgin and also become more familiar with the language invovled with writing, modifying and moving files from computer to cloud and vice versa
- This has helped me understand a bit better the processes in programming for web design and hopefully a lot more
basics of what is html, css and javascript in web design. Becoming more familiar with git commands in relation to working on projects and saving them to the cloud

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
