## Description

I created this guide as an exercise through bootcamp for front end web development. It was an exercise in showing you how to use the various languages HTML, CSS, Git and Javascript in designing and manipulating webpages

-I am motivated to learn this course in order to help me improve web design and see freelance career opportunities in this field
- I built this project to understand the principles of these languages in web desgin and also become more familiar with the language invovled with writing, modifying and moving files from computer to cloud and vice versa
- This has helped me understand a bit better the processes in programming for web design and hopefully a lot more
basics of what is html, css and javascript in web design. Becoming more familiar with git commands in relation to working on projects and saving them to the cloud
